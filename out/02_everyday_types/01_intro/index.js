// In this chapter, we’ll cover some of the most common types of values you’ll
// find in JavaScript code, and explain the corresponding ways to describe those
// types in TypeScript. This isn’t an exhaustive list, and future chapters will
// describe more ways to name and use other types.
// Types can also appear in many more places than just type annotations. As we
// learn about the types themselves, we’ll also learn about the places where we
// can refer to these types to form new constructs.
// We’ll start by reviewing the most basic and common types you might encounter 
// when writing JavaScript or TypeScript code. These will later form the core 
// building blocks of more complex types.
